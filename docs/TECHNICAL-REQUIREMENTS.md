# Technical Requirements

Build-ready engineering constraints derived from [PROPOSAL.md](./PROPOSAL.md).

## 1. Monorepo Structure

```

├── apps/
│   ├── api/              ← NestJS backend
│   ├── user-web/         ← Vue 3 SPA for all users (timer, time entries, profile)
│   ├── admin-web/        ← Vue 3 SPA for admins + PMs (reports, invoices, management)
│   └── chrome-ext/       ← Reserved placeholder for a future browser extension
├── packages/
│   └── shared/           ← shared TypeScript types, constants, Zod schemas
├── turbo.json
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
└── package.json          ← root workspace scripts only
```

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declares `apps/*` and `packages/*`.
- Turborepo orchestrates build pipelines across packages.
- The workspace root owns shared scripts for `dev`, `build`, `typecheck`, `test`, and `lint`.
- TypeScript base compiler settings live in `tsconfig.base.json` and are extended by each app/package.
- OpenSpec lives at the repo root in `openspec/` and organizes behavior specs by domain under `openspec/specs/<domain>/`. See [OPENSPEC.md](./OPENSPEC.md).

## 2. Backend — NestJS API

### 2.1 Stack

| Aspect            | Decision                                                       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime           | Node.js 24 LTS with TypeScript                                 |
| Framework         | NestJS (modular monolith)                                      |
| Query builder     | Drizzle ORM (type-safe SQL, schema-as-code)                    |

| Validation        | Zod schemas (shared via `packages/shared`)                     |
| API documentation | Swagger / OpenAPI (implemented in `apps/api`, not in web apps) |
| Auth              | Firebase Auth (identity provider) + JWT (API auth)             |
| GitHub            | GitHub App (user-to-server), connected per-user in profile     |

### 2.2 Authentication — JWT Token-Based

All users authenticate via **Firebase Auth** (Google SSO or email/password) on the frontend. The backend **does not handle login UI** — it verifies Firebase ID tokens and issues its own JWT token pair.

See [ADR 002](./adr/002-jwt-authentication.md) for rationale.

**Auth flow:**

```
User → Firebase Auth (Google SSO or email/password) on frontend
                               ↓
                           Frontend receives Firebase ID token (JWT)
                               ↓
                           Frontend sends Firebase ID token to POST /auth/login
                               ↓
                           Backend verifies Firebase ID token via Firebase Admin SDK
                               ↓
                           Backend resolves local user and active workspace membership
                               ↓
                           If no active membership → 401 Unauthorized
                               ↓
                           Backend issues JWT access token (short-lived) + refresh token (long-lived)
                           Access token carries: sub, email, firebaseUid, workspaceId, role
                               ↓
                           Frontend stores tokens in memory (access) and localStorage (refresh)
                               ↓
                           All API requests include: Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

**Onboarding model:** Application access is invite-only. New users are added exclusively through the invite-acceptance flow (`POST /invites/accept`). The login endpoint does not create users or memberships - it only issues sessions for users who already have an existing local user record and an active workspace membership.

**Invite accept page flow:** Invite emails link to the User SPA at `/invites/accept?token=<invite-token>`. This route is unauthenticated and outside the authenticated app shell. Invited Firebase identities are provisioned by the backend with the Firebase Admin SDK during invite creation or delivery, because browser self-service Firebase signup may be disabled by project policy. The API never receives or stores raw passwords. Invite email copy must guide first-time invitees to use Firebase's password setup/reset flow for the invited email, then return to the invite accept page and sign in. After Firebase sign-in with email/password or Google returns an identity token, the page submits `POST /invites/accept` with the invite token and Firebase ID token, then creates the normal app API session with that same Firebase ID token after invite acceptance returns `204 No Content`. Missing, expired, reused, or unknown invite tokens are terminal link errors; email mismatch is retryable with the correct identity. If Firebase sign-in succeeds but invite acceptance fails, the page must keep the user on a retry/recovery state and explain whether to retry acceptance, switch accounts, or request a fresh invite; the backend must remain the source of truth for invite validity and membership creation.

**Token lifecycle:**

| Token              | Lifetime   | Storage                                               |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Access token (JWT) | 15 minutes | Memory (frontend), `chrome.storage` (extension)       |
| Refresh token      | 7 days     | localStorage (frontend), `chrome.storage` (extension) |

**Refresh flow:** When the access token expires, the frontend calls `POST /auth/refresh` with the refresh token. The backend validates the refresh token, rotates it (invalidates old, issues new), and returns a new access/refresh pair.

**CORS:** The backend configures CORS with allowed origins from the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable (comma-separated list of frontend URLs).

### 2.3 GitHub Integration — GitHub App (User-to-Server)

GitHub is an **optional integration** that users connect in their profile. It uses a **GitHub App** with user-to-server authentication, following [GitHub's official recommendation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app).

See [ADR 003](./adr/003-github-app-user-to-server.md) for rationale.

**OAuth connection flow:**

```
User → clicks "Connect GitHub" in profile settings
                               ↓
                           Frontend calls GET /github/auth-url (with JWT)
                               ↓
                           Backend creates an unguessable opaque state id backed by
                           github_oauth_states with user binding, PKCE verifier,
                           expiry, and unconsumed status
                           Backend returns GitHub OAuth authorization URL with state id
                           and PKCE challenge
                               ↓
                          Browser navigates to GitHub → user authorizes the app
                               ↓
                           GitHub redirects to GET /github/callback?code=...&state=...
                          (browser redirect — no Authorization header)
                               ↓
                            Backend validates the opaque state id against github_oauth_states,
                           checks expiry, consumes it once, and identifies the bound user
                          Backend exchanges `code` for GitHub user access token + refresh token
                          Backend stores encrypted tokens in GitHubConnection
                                ↓
                            Backend redirects user to USER_SPA_URL/profile
```

The user SPA handles the redirect result on `/profile` and surfaces success or failure with toast notifications only.

The callback redirect contract uses `github` as the outcome query key:

- `github=connected` for successful connection completion.
- `github=error&code=<safe-error-code>` for handled failures, where `code` is a backend-defined safe enum such as `invalid_state`, `github_exchange_failed`, or `github_config`.

Frontend callback handling must treat only those documented `github` values as supported outcomes.

**Note:** The callback endpoint is unauthenticated (browser redirect from GitHub). User identification relies on the validated server-side OAuth state row, not on the GiTiempo JWT or a self-contained signed state JWT.

**Token lifecycle (per GitHub docs):**

| Token type        | Prefix | Lifetime                    |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| User access token | `ghu_` | 8 hours (28800 seconds)     |
| Refresh token     | `ghr_` | 6 months (15897600 seconds) |

**On-demand sync (lazy):**

- Projects and tasks are provider-neutral core records. External provider identity is stored in external reference tables, not as `github_*` fields on core records.
- GitHub is the MVP sync adapter and populates `project_external_refs` / `task_external_refs` with `provider = 'github'`.
- The backend maintains a local cache. Stale data is refreshed on the next request.
- No background jobs or webhooks for sync in MVP — the user's action triggers the refresh.

### 2.4 Role-Based Access Control

Three roles: `admin`, `pm`, `member`.

| Guard               | Logic                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AuthGuard`         | Verifies JWT access token from `Authorization` header. Attaches `user` to request.                         |
| `RoleGuard`         | Checks `WorkspaceMember.role` against required roles.                                                      |
| `ProjectScopeGuard` | For project-scoped endpoints: admins have implicit access; `pm` and `member` users need assignment to an active project. |

**Admin endpoints** require `role = 'admin'`.
**PM management endpoints** require `role IN ('admin', 'pm')`; PMs are limited to assigned projects.
**Member project endpoints** require any authenticated user with project visibility.
**Project assignment endpoints** are admin-only; assignment targets may be `pm` or `member` users. Assignments remain valid if a user changes between `pm` and `member`.

### 2.5 API Design Principles

- RESTful endpoints, JSON request/response.
- All validation uses Zod schemas from `packages/shared`.
- Role-based access control via NestJS guards.
- Standard error response format: `{ error: string, message: string, statusCode: number }`.
- Full endpoint contract: see [API-ENDPOINTS.md](./API-ENDPOINTS.md).

### 2.6 Migration & Seed Rules

- Each migration is a single `.ts` file exporting `up()` and `down()`.
- Migrations run automatically on API startup (configurable).
- **Seed data** in `apps/api/src/db/seeds/` — only for development/staging.
- Production seed: default workspace + initial admin user (preconfigured email/Firebase UID).

### 2.7 Swagger / OpenAPI Plan

- Swagger is an API concern and will be added when `apps/api` is initialized.
- The web apps do not install Swagger dependencies.
- During the current frontend bootstrap phase, the source of truth for shared contracts is `packages/shared`.
- `packages/shared` exports TypeScript types and Zod schemas that can be consumed by both SPAs and the future API.
- Frontend-only theme/bootstrap code lives in `packages/web-config` so the API is not coupled to PrimeVue or Tailwind setup.
- When the NestJS API is bootstrapped, it should publish Swagger / OpenAPI docs for external API documentation while continuing to reuse the shared contracts where practical.

## 3. Frontend — Vue 3 SPAs

Both User SPA and Admin SPA share the same stack:

| Aspect            | Decision                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework         | Vue 3 Composition API + `<script setup>`              |
| State management  | Pinia (stores in `src/stores/`)                       |
| Composables       | VueUse for browser APIs, timers, async state          |
| Component library | PrimeVue (forms, tables, overlays, dialogs)           |
| Styling           | Tailwind CSS (utility-first)                          |
| Router            | Vue Router                                            |
| HTTP client       | Axios (or fetch wrapper from shared package)          |
| Auth              | Firebase Auth SDK (client-side) → JWT tokens from API |

### 3.0 Frontend Platform Baseline

The current web frontend baseline includes:

- Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript for both `apps/user-web` and `apps/admin-web`
- Tailwind CSS v4 using CSS-first `@theme` setup
- PrimeVue v4 styled mode with a shared Aura-derived preset
- Pinia, Vue Router, VueUse, Heroicons, and PrimeIcons installed and connected
- Shared contract exports from `packages/shared`
- Shared frontend theme/bootstrap exports from `packages/web-config`
- Both SPAs are expected to use the same frontend auth model: Firebase sign-in, backend token exchange, refresh-token bootstrap, and logout cleanup
- `apps/user-web` currently has route structure for login and authenticated pages mounted through an app shell
- `apps/user-web` currently has the frontend auth wiring in place: Firebase email/password or Google sign-in, `POST /auth/login` token exchange, `GET /users/me` profile bootstrap, `POST /auth/refresh` session restore, and `POST /auth/logout` cleanup
- Focused Vitest coverage in `apps/user-web` for auth store and router-guard behavior
- `apps/admin-web` follows the same JWT session direction as `apps/user-web`, even where concrete route/screen implementation is still catching up

### 3.1 User SPA (`apps/user-web/`)

**Pages:**

- Dashboard — weekly top task/project insight, summary stats, recent time entries
- Global top-bar timer — task selector dialog (visible project → task), start/stop
- Time Entries — list, edit, delete own entries
- Projects — visible projects grouped with active task create, update, frontend search, and conditional hard-delete flows
- Profile — display name, GitHub connection (connect/disconnect)

### 3.2 Admin SPA (`apps/admin-web/`)

**Pages:**

- Dashboard — workspace overview, summary stats
- Reports — filter by project/user/date range, aggregated tables (PM: assigned projects only)
- Invoices — create, view status, list (PM: assigned projects only)
- Members — invite, manage roles, assign users to projects (Admin only)
- Projects — manage project visibility, member assignments, and assigned-member filtering (Admin only)
- Settings — workspace config: name, currency, default hourly rate, time zone (Admin only)

### 3.3 Shared UI Patterns

- Both SPAs import `packages/shared` for types and validation schemas.
- Both SPAs import `packages/web-config` for shared PrimeVue and Tailwind bootstrap configuration.
- Common UI patterns (avatars, date pickers, task selectors) can be extracted to a shared UI package later if duplication becomes problematic.
- Both SPAs use the same JWT-based auth flow - Firebase Auth login, exchange the Firebase ID token at `POST /auth/login`, then use the returned JWT access token for API requests.
- Both SPAs should expose visible cross-links to the counterpart workspace so users can switch between `user-web` and `admin-web` from the shell/login surfaces rather than relying on manual URL changes.

---

## 4. Chrome Extension (`apps/chrome-ext/`)

**Architecture:**

- Manifest V3 extension.
- Content script injected on `github.com/*/issues/*` pages.
- Detects issue from page URL (`org/repo/issues/123`).
- Authenticates via a popup login flow (Firebase Auth), stores JWT tokens in `chrome.storage`.
- Sends JWT access token in `Authorization` header on all API requests.

**Auto-create flow (lazy creation):**

When the user clicks "Start Timer" on a GitHub issue page, the extension sends a single API request. The backend handles creation automatically:

```
POST /api/time-entries/timer/start-from-github
Body: { githubRepo: "org/repo", issueNumber: 123, issueTitle: "Bug fix..." }

Backend logic:
1. Find or create Project for "org/repo" and link it through `project_external_refs` (`provider: 'github'`, `external_type: 'repository'`, `external_key: 'org/repo'`)
2. Find or create Task for issue #123 within that project and link it through `task_external_refs` (`provider: 'github'`, `external_type: 'issue'`, `external_key: 'org/repo#123'`)
3. Create TimeEntry (running timer) linked to the task and user
4. Return the time entry
```

This means the **first person to start a timer on any GitHub issue** automatically creates provider-neutral project and task records plus GitHub external refs. Subsequent users on the same issue will find the existing records through those refs. No manual setup required.

---

## 5. Shared Package (`packages/shared/`)

Contains:

- **TypeScript interfaces** — all API request/response shapes (`TimeEntry`, `Workspace`, `Task`, etc.).
- **Zod schemas** — runtime validation matching the TypeScript types.
- **Constants** — status enums, role definitions, error codes.
- **Utility functions** — date formatting, duration calculations.

Both the API and both SPAs depend on this package.

Current bootstrap contents include:

- `src/contracts/` for shared TypeScript + Zod definitions

## 5.1 Web Config Package (`packages/web-config/`)

Contains frontend-only bootstrap configuration shared by `user-web` and `admin-web`:

- PrimeVue preset and app install options
- Shared Tailwind token stylesheet

Only frontend applications should depend on this package.

---

## 6. Deployment

| Component        | Strategy                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API              | Docker container, deployed via Docker Compose on VPS                |
| User SPA         | Cloudflare Workers Static Assets                                    |
| Admin SPA        | Cloudflare Workers Static Assets                                    |
| Chrome Extension | Chrome Web Store (manual publish)                                   |
| Database         | PostgreSQL on VPS (Docker Compose service)                          |
| Firebase         | Firebase project (Auth service only, free tier)                     |
| GitHub App       | Configured in GitHub Developer Settings, callback URL points to API |

Deployment workflows are defined in [deployment.md](./deployment.md). Frontend hosting is recorded in [ADR 005](./adr/005-cloudflare-workers-static-assets.md), and API hosting is recorded in [ADR 006](./adr/006-api-vps-docker-compose.md).

---

## 7. Task Sync Adapter Architecture

The codebase uses an adapter interface for task synchronization so that future integrations (Jira, Trello, etc.) only require a new adapter implementation.

```
TaskSyncAdapter (interface)
├── GitHubAdapter      ← MVP: syncs GitHub issues via user-to-server token
├── (future) JiraAdapter
├── (future) TrelloAdapter
└── ManualAdapter      ← local tasks with no external sync
```

Each adapter implements:

- `syncTasks(projectId, userToken)` — pull tasks from external system into the project
- `createTask(projectId, data, userToken)` — create task in external system (if supported)
- `resolveTask(externalRef)` — find or create a local task from an external reference (used by Chrome Extension auto-create)

Adapters MUST keep provider-specific identifiers, URLs, and raw metadata in `project_external_refs` and `task_external_refs`. Core `projects` and `tasks` remain integration-neutral so future providers do not require schema changes to the core work-tracking model.

---

## 8. Testing Strategy

**Unit tests:** Vitest for all packages. Business logic, Zod schemas, utility functions.

**Integration tests:** NestJS testing utilities + ephemeral PostgreSQL in Docker. Cover auth flows, RBAC guards, time entry CRUD, GitHub sync adapter. API integration/e2e tests must not use a developer local database, staging database, production database, or any shared persistent CI database.

**E2E tests (deferred post-MVP):** Playwright for critical user flows (login, timer start/stop, report generation).

**Convention:** Tests co-located with source files (`*.spec.ts`). CI runs lint, typecheck, unit tests, and API integration/e2e tests when backend or shared contracts change. The test isolation decision is recorded in [ADR 007](./adr/007-ci-ephemeral-postgres.md), and the automated test process is defined in [testing.md](./testing.md).

---

## 9. Logging & Observability

**Structured logging:** All backend logs are JSON-formatted using a NestJS logger (e.g. `nestjs-pino`). Each log line includes: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `requestId`, `userId`, `module`.

**Log levels:** `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`. Production runs at `info` level.

**Metrics:** Expose a `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus format) via `@willsoto/nestjs-prometheus` or equivalent. Key metrics:

- HTTP request duration (histogram, by method/route/status)
- Active timers count (gauge)
- GitHub API call count and latency (counter/histogram)
- Auth token refresh count (counter)

**Health check:** `GET /commons/health/ready` — returns DB connectivity status. `GET /commons/health/live` is the liveness probe. Used by Docker Compose health checks and external monitoring.

**Log collection:** JSON logs are written to stdout. In production, collected by any standard log aggregator (Loki, Fluentd, ELK) from Docker container stdout.

---

## 10. Error Handling

> TBD — will define error taxonomy, retry policies, and client-side error handling before first sprint.

---

## 11. CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions is the CI/CD orchestrator. Workflows must support manual `workflow_dispatch` runs and automatic deployment from the `staging` branch.

Frontend deploy workflows build and deploy `apps/user-web` and `apps/admin-web` independently to Cloudflare Workers Static Assets. API deploy workflows build a Docker image, validate it against an ephemeral PostgreSQL database, push it to a registry, and deploy it to the VPS through Docker Compose.

See [deployment.md](./deployment.md) and [testing.md](./testing.md) for trigger rules, test gates, and release order.

---

## 12. Environment Variables

The API requires the following environment variables:

| Variable                   | Description                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`             | PostgreSQL connection string                                                                          |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`          | Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins (e.g. `https://app.tiempo.com,https://admin.tiempo.com`) |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`        | Secret for signing JWT access tokens                                                                  |
| `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`       | Secret for signing JWT refresh tokens                                                                 |
| `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`      | Firebase project ID                                                                                   |
